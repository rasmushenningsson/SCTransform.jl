This is a Julia implementation of [sctransform](https://github.com/satijalab/sctransform), based on the paper [Normalization and variance stabilization of single-cell RNA-seq data using regularized negative binomial regression](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1874-1) by Hafemaister and Satija.

This is an independent implementation, the original authors were not involved.
